# react-todo

This is an ongoing project where I reiterate the familiar task of building a Todo app.  Since React is more of a library than a highly opinionated framework, there are many approaches that can be used to solve the same problem.  Each iteration is designed to showcase a different pattern or library from the exciting ecosystem of the React Community.  

Navigate the various branches to explore these different approaches, which include:
 * [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
 * [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
 * [Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose)
 * [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)

### Running the App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### Roadmap
Some future techniques I would like to showcase include:
*[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
*[Redux Form](http://redux-form.com/7.0.3/)
*[Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)
